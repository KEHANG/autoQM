# connect to registration table

# search entries with status "job_launched" or "job_running"
# check the job slurm-status, e.g., scontrol show jobid 5037088
# 1. Invalid job id specified: means the job is off queue
#    1.1 check job folder if input.log file is there
#			Yes: job already finished
#			No:  job is aborted before even calculation start: job_aborted
#    1.2 if finished, check "Normal termination" key words should appear twice
#			Yes: job is converged
#			No:  job fails convergence (possibly need more wall-time): job_failed_convergence
#    1.3 if converged, check isomorphism between input molecule and output molecule
#			Yes: job is success: job_success
#			No:  job fails isomorphism (possibly need tweak on initial structure): job_failed_isomorphism
# 2. output string starts with e.g, "JobId=5037088"
#    2.1 check JobState
#		RUNNING: running: job_running
#		else:   still job_launched 

# update status accordingly
